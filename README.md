# Smile
Smile was a project I made for a course at WSU that focused on full-stack development. The professor for this course gave the students a bare-minumum guide to follow as well as some starter code. My Smile project is a web application where anyone share something that made them smile and select an emoji to match their mood. Other users on the web application are aloud to "like" anyones post if they happen to like to another users post. This application is deployed on a heroku server, and can be found at https://partain-warmup.herokuapp.com .
